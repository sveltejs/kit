# adapter-static

Adapter for Svelte apps that prerenders your entire site as a collection of static files, which is equivalent to `sapper export`.

This is very experimental. The adapter API is still in flux and will likely change before 1.0.

Install with:
```bash
npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static@next
```
