			 * - If `'split'`, splits the app up into multiple .js/.css files so that they are loaded lazily as the user navigates around the app. This is the default, and is recommended for most scenarios.
			 * - If `'single'`, creates just one .js bundle and one .css file containing code for the entire app.
			 * - If `'inline'`, inlines all JavaScript and CSS of the entire app into the HTML. The result is usable without a server (i.e. you can just open the file in your browser).

			 * This has several advantages:
			 * - The client does not need to load the routing manifest upfront, which can lead to faster initial page loads
			 * - The list of routes is hidden from public view
			 * - The server has an opportunity to intercept each navigation (for example through a middleware), enabling (for example) A/B testing opaque to SvelteKit
