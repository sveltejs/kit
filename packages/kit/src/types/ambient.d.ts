/**
 * It's possible to tell SvelteKit how to type objects inside your app by declaring the `App` namespace. By default, a new project will have a file called `src/app.d.ts` containing the following:
 *
 * ```ts
 * declare global {
 * 	namespace App {
 * 		// interface Error {}
 * 		// interface Locals {}
 * 		// interface PageData {}
 * 		// interface PageState {}
 * 		// interface Platform {}
 * 	}
 * }
 *
 * export {};
 * ```
 *
 * The `export {}` line exists because without it, the file would be treated as an _ambient module_ which prevents you from adding `import` declarations.
 * If you need to add ambient `declare module` declarations, do so in a separate file like `src/ambient.d.ts`.
 *
 * By populating these interfaces, you will gain type safety when using `event.locals`, `event.platform`, and `data` from `load` functions.
 */

	/**
