	 * This makes the use of specific features visible at both dev and build time, in such a
	 * way that we can error when they are not supported by the target platform.
	 *
	 * During dev, `globalThis.__SVELTEKIT_TRACK__` is a function that grabs the current `event`
	 * and route `config` (from an AsyncLocalStorage instance) and calls the relevant `supports`
	 * function on the adapter (e.g. `adapter.supports.read(...)`).
	 *
	 * At build time, if the function containing the `__SVELTEKIT_TRACK__` call is untreeshaken,
	 * we locate it in the `renderChunk` build hook and a) make a note of the chunk that contains
	 * it and b) replace it with a comment. Later, we can use this information to establish
	 * which routes use which feature, and use the same `adapter.supports.read(...)` function
	 * to throw an error if the feature would fail in production.
