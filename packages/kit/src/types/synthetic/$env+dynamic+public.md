Similar to [`$env/dynamic/private`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$env-dynamic-private), but only includes variables that begin with [`config.kit.env.publicPrefix`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#env) (which defaults to `PUBLIC_`), and can therefore safely be exposed to client-side code.

Note that public dynamic environment variables must all be sent from the server to the client, causing larger network requests — when possible, use `$env/static/public` instead.

Dynamic environment variables cannot be used during prerendering.

```ts
import { env } from '$env/dynamic/public';
console.log(env.PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_SPECIFIC_VARIABLE);
```
