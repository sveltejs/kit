	 *
	 * To add a nonce for scripts and links manually included in `src/app.html`, you may use the placeholder `%sveltekit.nonce%` (for example `<script nonce="%sveltekit.nonce%">`).

		 * This has several advantages:
		 * - The client does not need to load the routing manifest upfront, which can lead to faster initial page loads
		 * - The list of routes is hidden from public view
		 * - The server has an opportunity to intercept each navigation (for example through a middleware), enabling (for example) A/B testing opaque to SvelteKit

	 * - It can make relative requests on the server (ordinarily, `fetch` requires a URL with an origin when used in a server context).
	 * - Internal requests (e.g. for `+server.js` routes) go directly to the handler function when running on the server, without the overhead of an HTTP call.
	 * - During server-side rendering, the response will be captured and inlined into the rendered HTML by hooking into the `text` and `json` methods of the `Response` object. Note that headers will _not_ be serialized, unless explicitly included via [`filterSerializedResponseHeaders`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/hooks#Server-hooks-handle)
	 * - During hydration, the response will be read from the HTML, guaranteeing consistency and preventing an additional network request.
