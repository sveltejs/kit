	 * To add a nonce for scripts and links manually included in `src/app.html`, you may use the placeholder `%sveltekit.nonce%` (for example `<script nonce="%sveltekit.nonce%">`).

	 * This function declares that the `load` function has a _dependency_ on one or more URLs or custom identifiers, which can subsequently be used with [`invalidate()`](/docs/modules#$app-navigation-invalidate) to cause `load` to rerun.
	 *
	 * Most of the time you won't need this, as `fetch` calls `depends` on your behalf — it's only necessary if you're using a custom API client that bypasses `fetch`.
	 *
	 * URLs can be absolute or relative to the page being loaded, and must be [encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding).
	 *
	 * Custom identifiers have to be prefixed with one or more lowercase letters followed by a colon to conform to the [URI specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html).
	 *
	 * The following example shows how to use `depends` to register a dependency on a custom identifier, which is `invalidate`d after a button click, making the `load` function rerun.
	 *
	 * ```js
	 * /// file: src/routes/+page.js
	 * let count = 0;
	 * export async function load({ depends }) {
	 * 	depends('increase:count');
	 *
	 * 	return { count: count++ };

	 * 	import { invalidate } from '$app/navigation';
	 *
	 * 	export let data;
