But beyond that, building an app with all the modern best practices is fiendishly complicated. Those practices include build optimizations, so that you load only the minimal required code; offline support; preloading pages before the user initiates navigation; configurable rendering that allows you to render different parts of your app on the server with SSR, in the browser client-side rendering, or at build-time with prerendering; and many other things.

They tell tooling what file to import when they look up the your-library import:\n\nTypeScript sees the types condition and looks up the type definition file. If you don't publish type definitions, omit this condition.\nSvelte-aware tooling sees the svelte condition and knows this is a Svelte component library. If you publish a library that does not export any Svelte components and that could also work in non-Svelte projects (for example a Svelte store library), you can replace this condition with default.\n\nPrevious versions of @sveltejs/package also added a package.json export. This is no longer part of the template because all tooling can now deal with a package.json not being explicitly exported.\n\n\nYou can adjust exports to your liking and provide more entry points.

Read more about the caveat here\n\n\nIn general, each key of the exports map is the path the user will have to use to import something from your package, and the value is the path to the file that will be imported or a map of export conditions which in turn contains these file paths.\n\nRead more about exports here."},{"breadcrumbs":["Packaging","Anatomy of a package.json","svelte"],"href":"/docs/packaging#anatomy-of-a-package-json-svelte","content":"This is a legacy field that enabled tooling to recognise Svelte component libraries.

By default, when packaging your library, type definitions are auto-generated for JavaScript, TypeScript and Svelte files. All you need to ensure is that the types condition in the exports map points to the correct files. When initialising a library project through npm create svelte@latest, this is automatically setup for the root export.\n\nIf you have something else than a root export however — for example providing a your-library/foo import — you need to take additional care for providing type definitions. Unfortunately, TypeScript by default will not resolve the types condition for an export like { &quot;./foo&quot;: { &quot;types&quot;: &quot;./dist/foo.d.ts&quot;, ... }}. Instead, it will search for a foo.d.ts relative to the root of your library (i.e. your-library/foo.d.ts instead of your-library/dist/foo.d.ts). To fix this, you have two options:\n\nThe first option is to require people using your library to set the moduleResolution option in their tsconfig/jsconfig.json to bundler (available since TypeScript 5, the best and recommended option in the future), node16 or nodenext. This opts TypeScript into actually looking at the exports map and resolving the types correctly.\n\nThe second option is to (ab)use the typesVersions feature from TypeScript to wire up the types. This is a field inside package.json TypeScript uses to check for different type definitions depending on the TypeScript version, and also contains a path mapping feature for that. We leverage that path mapping feature to get what we want. For the mentioned foo export above, the corresponding typesVersions looks like this:\n\n{\n    \"exports\": {\n        \"./foo\": {\n            \"types\": \"./dist/foo.d.ts\",\n            \"svelte\": \"./dist/foo.js\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"typesVersions\": {\n        \">4.0\": {\n            \"foo\": [\"./dist/foo.d.ts\"]\n        }\n    }\n}>4.0 tells TypeScript to check the inner map if the used TypeScript version is greater than 4 (which should in practice always be true). The inner map tells TypeScript that the typings for your-library/foo are found within ./dist/foo.d.ts, which essentially replicates the exports condition. You also have * as a wildcard at your disposal to make many type definitions at once available without repeating yourself. Note that if you opt into typesVersions you have to declare all type imports through it, including the root import (which is defined as &quot;index&quot;: [..]).\n\nYou can read more about that feature here."},{"breadcrumbs":["Packaging","Best practices"],"href":"/docs/packaging#best-practices","content":"You should avoid using SvelteKit-specific modules like $app in your packages unless you intend for them to only be consumable by other SvelteKit projects.

However, it generates larger HTML output and reduces the effectiveness of browser caches. Use it advisedly.\n\n\n\n\nmoduleExtensions\n\n\ndefault\n [&quot;.js&quot;, &quot;.ts&quot;]\n\n\nAn array of file extensions that SvelteKit will treat as modules.

There\nare three strategies with different trade-offs:\n\nmodulepreload - uses <link rel=&quot;modulepreload&quot;>. This delivers the best results in Chromium-based browsers, but is currently ignored by Firefox and Safari (though support is coming to Safari soon).\npreload-js - uses <link rel=&quot;preload&quot;>. Prevents waterfalls in Chromium and Safari, but Chromium will parse each module twice (once as a script, once as a module). Causes modules to be requested twice in Firefox. This is a good setting if you want to maximise performance for users on iOS devices at the cost of a very slight degradation for Chromium users.\npreload-mjs - uses <link rel=&quot;preload&quot;> but with the .mjs extension which prevents double-parsing in Chromium. Some static webservers will fail to serve .mjs files with a Content-Type: application/javascript header, which will cause your application to break. If that doesn't apply to you, this is the option that will deliver the best performance for the largest number of users, until modulepreload is more widely supported.\n\n\n\npaths\n\n\n\n\nassets?: '' | `http://${string}` | `https://${string}`;\n\n\ndefault\n &quot;&quot;\n\n\nAn absolute path that your app's files are served from. This is useful if your files are served from a storage bucket of some kind.\n\n\nbase?: '' | `/${string}`;\n\n\ndefault\n &quot;&quot;\n\n\nA root-relative path that must start, but not end with / (e.g. /base-path), unless it is the empty string. This specifies where your app is served from and allows the app to live on a non-root path. Note that you need to prepend all your root-relative links with the base value or they will point to the root of your domain, not your base (this is how the browser works). You can use base from $app/paths for that: <a href=&quot;{base}/your-page&quot;>Link</a>. If you find yourself writing this often, it may make sense to extract this into a reusable component.\n\n\nrelative?: boolean | undefined;\n\n\ndefault\n undefined\n\n\nWhether to use relative asset paths. By default, if paths.assets is not external, SvelteKit will replace %sveltekit.assets% with a relative path and use relative paths to reference build artifacts, but base and assets imported from $app/paths will be as specified in your config.\n\nIf true, base and assets imported from $app/paths will be replaced with relative asset paths during server-side rendering, resulting in portable HTML.\nIf false, %sveltekit.assets% and references to build artifacts will always be root-relative paths, unless paths.assets is an external URL\n\nIf your app uses a <base> element, you should set this to false, otherwise asset URLs will incorrectly be resolved against the <base> URL rather than the current page.\n\n\n\nprerender\n\n\nSee Prerendering.\n\n\n\nconcurrency?: number;\n\n\ndefault\n 1\n\n\nHow many pages can be prerendered simultaneously. JS is single-threaded, but in cases where prerendering performance is network-bound (for example loading content from a remote CMS) this can speed things up by processing other tasks while waiting on the network response.\n\n\ncrawl?: boolean;\n\n\ndefault\n true\n\n\nWhether SvelteKit should find pages to prerender by following links from entries.\n\n\nentries?: Array<'*' | `/${string}`>;\n\n\ndefault\n [&quot;*&quot;]\n\n\nAn array of pages to prerender, or start crawling from (if crawl: true).

You can mutate the config (recommended) or return a new one.\nThis is useful for extending a shared tsconfig.json in a monorepo root, for example.\n\n\n\nversion\n\n\nClient-side navigation can be buggy if you deploy a new version of your app while people are using it. If the code for the new page is already loaded, it may have stale content; if it isn't, the app's route manifest may point to a JavaScript file that no longer exists.\nSvelteKit helps you solve this problem through version management.\nIf SvelteKit encounters an error while loading the page and detects that a new version has been deployed (using the name specified here, which defaults to a timestamp of the build) it will fall back to traditional full-page navigation.\nNot all navigations will result in an error though, for example if the JavaScript for the next page is already loaded. If you still want to force a full-page navigation in these cases, use techniques such as setting the pollInterval and then using beforeNavigate:\n\n/// +layout.svelte\n<script>\nimport { beforeNavigate } from '$app/navigation';\nimport { updated } from '$app/stores';\n\nbeforeNavigate(({ willUnload, to }) => {\n    if ($updated && !willUnload && to?.url) {\n        location.href = to.url.href;\n    }\n});\n</script>If you set pollInterval to a non-zero value, SvelteKit will poll for new versions in the background and set the value of the updated store to true when it detects one.\n\n\n\nname?: string;\nThe current app version string. If specified, this must be deterministic (e.g. a commit ref rather than Math.random() or Date.now().toString()), otherwise defaults to a timestamp of the build.\n\nFor example, to use the current commit hash, you could do use git rev-parse HEAD:\n\n// @errors: 7031\n/// file: svelte.config.js\nimport * as child_process from 'node:child_process';\n\nexport default {\n    kit: {\n        version: {\n            name: child_process.execSync('git rev-parse HEAD').toString().trim()\n        }\n    }\n};\npollInterval?: number;\n\n\ndefault\n 0\n\n\nThe interval in milliseconds to poll for version changes.

Svelte will then check that the DOM is in the expected state and attach event listeners in a process called hydration.

This approach has the same benefits as traditional server-rendered pages, but avoids recomputing the page for each visitor and so scales nearly for free as the number of visitors increases. The tradeoff is that the build process is more expensive and prerendered content can only be updated by building and deploying a new version of the application.\n\nNot all pages can be prerendered. The basic rule is this: for content to be prerenderable, any two users hitting it directly must get the same content from the server, and the page must not contain actions. Note that you can still prerender content that is loaded based on the page's parameters as long as all users will be seeing the same prerendered content.\n\nPre-rendered pages are not limited to static content. You can build personalized pages if user-specific data is fetched and rendered client-side.

SPAs do not provide SSR, which has the shortcoming described above.

However, in contrast to most purpose-built SSGs, SvelteKit does nicely allow for mixing and matching different rendering types on different pages. One benefit of fully prerendering a site is that you do not need to maintain or pay for servers to perform SSR. Once generated, the site can be served from CDNs, leading to great &quot;time to first byte&quot; performance.

If you saw Rich's presentation at the 2020 Svelte Summit, you may have seen a more powerful-looking version of HMR presented. This demo had svelte-hmr's preserveLocalState flag on. This flag is now off by default because it may lead to unexpected behaviour and edge cases. But don't worry, you are still getting HMR with SvelteKit! If you'd like to preserve local state you can use the @hmr:keep or @hmr:keep-all directives as documented on the svelte-hmr page."},{"breadcrumbs":["FAQ","How do I include details from package.json in my application?"],"href":"/faq#read-package-json","content":"You cannot directly require JSON files, since SvelteKit expects svelte.config.js to be an ES module. If you'd like to include your application's version number or other information from package.json in your application, you can load JSON like so:\n\nimport { readFileSync } from 'fs';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n\nconst file = fileURLToPath(new URL('package.json', import.meta.url));\nconst json = readFileSync(file, 'utf8');\nconst pkg = JSON.parse(json);"},{"breadcrumbs":["FAQ","How do I fix the error I'm getting trying to include a package?"],"href":"/faq#packages","content":"Most issues related to including a library are due to incorrect packaging. You can check if a library's packaging is compatible with Node.js by entering it into the publint website.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when checking if a library is packaged correctly:\n\nexports takes precedence over the other entry point fields such as main and module. Adding an exports field may not be backwards-compatible as it prevents deep imports.\nESM files should end with .mjs unless &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot; is set in which any case CommonJS files should end with .cjs.\nmain should be defined if exports is not. It should be either a CommonJS or ESM file and adhere to the previous bullet. If a module field is defined, it should refer to an ESM file.\nSvelte components should be distributed as uncompiled .svelte files with any JS in the package written as ESM only. Custom script and style languages, like TypeScript and SCSS, should be preprocessed as vanilla JS and CSS respectively. We recommend using svelte-package for packaging Svelte libraries, which will do this for you.\n\nLibraries work best in the browser with Vite when they distribute an ESM version, especially if they are dependencies of a Svelte component library. You may wish to suggest to library authors that they provide an ESM version. However, CommonJS (CJS) dependencies should work as well since, by default, vite-plugin-svelte will ask Vite to pre-bundle them using esbuild to convert them to ESM.\n\nIf you are still encountering issues we recommend searching both the Vite issue tracker and the issue tracker of the library in question. Sometimes issues can be worked around by fiddling with the optimizeDeps or ssr config values though we recommend this as only a short-term workaround in favor of fixing the library in question."},{"breadcrumbs":["FAQ","How do I use X with SvelteKit?"],"href":"/faq#integrations","content":"Make sure you've read the documentation section on integrations. If you're still having trouble, solutions to common issues are listed below.\n\nHow do I setup a database?\nPut the code to query your database in a server route - don't query the database in .svelte files. You can create a db.js or similar that sets up a connection immediately and makes the client accessible throughout the app as a singleton. You can execute any one-time setup code in hooks.js and import your database helpers into any endpoint that needs them.\n\nHow do I use a client-side only library that depends on document or window?\nIf you need access to the document or window variables or otherwise need code to run only on the client-side you can wrap it in a browser check:\n\nimport { browser } from '$app/environment';\n\nif (browser) {\n    // client-only code here\n}You can also run code in onMount if you'd like to run it after the component has been first rendered to the DOM:\n\nimport { onMount } from 'svelte';\n\nonMount(async () => {\n    const { method } = await import('some-browser-only-library');\n    method('hello world');\n});If the library you'd like to use is side-effect free you can also statically import it and it will be tree-shaken out in the server-side build where onMount will be automatically replaced with a no-op:\n\nimport { onMount } from 'svelte';\nimport { method } from 'some-browser-only-library';\n\nonMount(() => {\n    method('hello world');\n});Otherwise, if the library has side effects and you'd still prefer to use static imports, check out vite-plugin-iso-import to support the ?client import suffix. The import will be stripped out in SSR builds. However, note that you will lose the ability to use VS Code Intellisense if you use this method.\n\nimport { onMount } from 'svelte';\nimport { method } from 'some-browser-only-library?client';\n\nonMount(() => {\n    method('hello world');\n});How do I use a different backend API server?\nYou can use event.fetch to request data from an external API server, but be aware that you would need to deal with CORS, which will result in complications such as generally requiring requests to be preflighted resulting in higher latency. Requests to a separate subdomain may also increase latency due to an additional DNS lookup, TLS setup, etc. If you wish to use this method, you may find handleFetch helpful.\n\nAnother approach is to set up a proxy to bypass CORS headaches. In production, you would rewrite a path like /api to the API server; for local development, use Vite's server.proxy option.\n\nHow to setup rewrites in production will depend on your deployment platform. If rewrites aren't an option, you could alternatively add an API route:\n\n/// file: src/routes/api/[...path]/+server.js\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\nexport function GET({ params, url }) {\n    return fetch(`https://my-api-server.com/${params.path + url.search}`);\n}(Note that you may also need to proxy POST/PATCH etc requests, and forward request.headers, depending on your needs.)\n\nHow do I use middleware?\nadapter-node builds a middleware that you can use with your own server for production mode. In dev, you can add middleware to Vite by using a Vite plugin. For example:\n\nimport { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\n/** @type {import('vite').Plugin} */\nconst myPlugin = {\n    name: 'log-request-middleware',\n    configureServer(server) {\n        server.middlewares.use((req, res, next) => {\n            console.log(`Got request ${req.url}`);\n            next();\n        });\n    }\n};\n\n/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */\nconst config = {\n    plugins: [myPlugin, sveltekit()]\n};\n\nexport default config;See Vite's configureServer docs for more details including how to control ordering.\n\nDoes it work with Yarn 2?\nSort of. The Plug'n'Play feature, aka 'pnp', is broken (it deviates from the Node module resolution algorithm, and doesn't yet work with native JavaScript modules which SvelteKit — along with an increasing number of packages — uses). You can use nodeLinker: 'node-modules' in your .yarnrc.yml file to disable pnp, but it's probably easier to just use npm or pnpm, which is similarly fast and efficient but without the compatibility headaches.\n\nHow do I use with Yarn 3?\nCurrently ESM Support within the latest Yarn (version 3) is considered experimental.\n\nThe below seems to work although your results may vary.\n\nFirst create a new application:\n\nyarn create svelte myapp\ncd myappAnd enable Yarn Berry:\n\nyarn set version berry\nyarn installYarn 3 global cache\n\nOne of the more interesting features of Yarn Berry is the ability to have a single global cache for packages, instead of having multiple copies for each project on the disk. However, setting enableGlobalCache to true causes building to fail, so it is recommended to add the following to the .yarnrc.yml file:\n\nnodeLinker: node-modulesThis will cause packages to be downloaded into a local node_modules directory but avoids the above problem and is your best bet for using version 3 of Yarn at this point in time."}]}
