SvelteKit will augment the specified directives with nonces or hashes (depending on `mode`) for any inline styles and scripts it generates.\n\nTo add a nonce for scripts and links manually included in `src/app.html`, you may use the placeholder `%sveltekit.nonce%` (for example `<script nonce=\"%sveltekit.nonce%\">`).\n\nWhen pages are prerendered, the CSP header is added via a `<meta http-equiv>` tag (note that in this case, `frame-ancestors`, `report-uri` and `sandbox` directives will be ignored).\n\n> When `mode` is `'auto'`, SvelteKit will use nonces for dynamically rendered pages and hashes for prerendered pages. Using nonces with prerendered pages is insecure and therefore forbidden.\n\n> Note that most [Svelte transitions](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/transition) work by creating an inline `<style>` element. If you use these in your app, you must either leave the `style-src` directive unspecified or add `unsafe-inline`.\n\nIf this level of configuration is insufficient and you have more dynamic requirements, you can use the [`handle` hook](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks#server-hooks-handle) to roll your own CSP.",

There\nare three strategies with different trade-offs:\n- `modulepreload` - uses `<link rel=\"modulepreload\">`. This delivers the best results in Chromium-based browsers, in Firefox 115+, and Safari 17+. It is ignored in older browsers.\n- `preload-js` - uses `<link rel=\"preload\">`. Prevents waterfalls in Chromium and Safari, but Chromium will parse each module twice (once as a script, once as a module). Causes modules to be requested twice in Firefox. This is a good setting if you want to maximise performance for users on iOS devices at the cost of a very slight degradation for Chromium users.\n- `preload-mjs` - uses `<link rel=\"preload\">` but with the `.mjs` extension which prevents double-parsing in Chromium. Some static webservers will fail to serve .mjs files with a `Content-Type: application/javascript` header, which will cause your application to break. If that doesn't apply to you, this is the option that will deliver the best performance for the largest number of users, until `modulepreload` is more widely supported.",

Note that headers will _not_ be serialized, unless explicitly included via [`filterSerializedResponseHeaders`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks#server-hooks-handle)\n- During hydration, the response will be read from the HTML, guaranteeing consistency and preventing an additional network request.\n\nYou can learn more about making credentialed requests with cookies [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#cookies)",
