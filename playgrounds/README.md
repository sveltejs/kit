You may use these playgrounds to experiment with your changes to SvelteKit. Make sure you don't check in any changes to this folder.

Alternatively, clone the [kit-sandbox](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit-sandbox) repo next to the `kit` repo, and use `pnpm link` to link your dependencies. This way you can have multiple different sandbox projects in different branches, and you never need to worry about accidentally committing throwaway code.
