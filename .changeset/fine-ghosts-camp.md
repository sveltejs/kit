Write output that conforms to the stable [Netlify Frameworks API](https://docs.netlify.com/build/frameworks/frameworks-api/).

POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE: Deploying and previewing with Netlify CLI now requires [v17.31.0](https://github.com/netlify/cli/releases/tag/v17.31.0) or later. `npm i -g netlify-cli@latest` to upgrade.
