## Bug reporting

Please make sure the issue you're reporting involves SvelteKit. Many issues related to how a project builds originate from [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which is used to build a SvelteKit project. You can create a new Vite project with `npm create vite@latest` for client-side only repros and `npm create vite-extra@latest` for SSR or library repros.

If an issue originates from Vite, please report it in the [Vite issue tracker](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues).
