question: How do I use X with SvelteKit?

### How do I setup library X?

Please see [sveltejs/integrations](https://github.com/sveltejs/integrations#sveltekit) for examples of using many popular libraries like Tailwind, PostCSS, Firebase, GraphQL, mdsvex, and more.

### How do I setup a database?

Put the code to query your database in [endpoints](../docs#routing-endpoints) - don't query the database in .svelte files. You can create a `db.js` or similar that sets up a connection immediately and makes the client accessible throughout the app as a singleton. You can execute any one-time setup code in `hooks.js` and import your database helpers into any endpoint that needs them.

### How do I use Axios?

You probably don't need it. We'd generally recommend you just use `fetch` instead. If you insist, you're probably better off using the ESM drop-in replacement `redaxios` [until axios utilizes ESM](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1879). Finally, if you still want to use Axios itself, try putting it in `optimizeDeps.include`.

### Does it work with Yarn 2?

Sort of. The Plug'n'Play feature, aka 'pnp', is broken (it deviates from the Node module resolution algorithm, and [doesn't yet work with native JavaScript modules](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/638) which SvelteKit — along with an [increasing number of packages](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/get-ready-for-esm-aa53530b3f77) — uses). You can use `nodeLinker: 'node-modules'` in your [`.yarnrc.yml`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker) file to disable pnp, but it's probably easier to just use npm or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which is similarly fast and efficient but without the compatibility headaches.
