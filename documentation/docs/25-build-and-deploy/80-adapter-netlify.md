title: Netlify
---

To deploy to Netlify, use [`adapter-netlify`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/adapter-netlify).

This adapter will be installed by default when you use [`adapter-auto`](adapter-auto), but adding it to your project allows you to specify Netlify-specific options.

## Usage

Install with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-netlify`, then add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js`:

```js
// @errors: 2307
/// file: svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';

export default {
	kit: {
		// default options are shown
		adapter: adapter({
			// if true, will create a Netlify Edge Function rather
			// than using standard Node-based functions
			edge: false,

			// if true, will split your app into multiple functions
			// instead of creating a single one for the entire app.
			// if `edge` is true, this option cannot be used
			split: false
		})
	}
};
```

Then, make sure you have a [netlify.toml](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration) file in the project root. This will determine where to write static assets based on the `build.publish` settings, as per this sample configuration:

```toml
[build]
	command = "npm run build"
	publish = "build"
```

If the `netlify.toml` file or the `build.publish` value is missing, a default value of `"build"` will be used. Note that if you have set the publish directory in the Netlify UI to something else then you will need to set it in `netlify.toml` too, or use the default value of `"build"`.

### Node version

New projects will use the current Node LTS version by default. However, if you're upgrading a project you created a while ago it may be stuck on an older version. See [the Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) for details on manually specifying a current Node version.

## Netlify Edge Functions

SvelteKit supports [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/netlify-labs/experimental-features/edge-functions/). If you pass the option `edge: true` to the `adapter` function, server-side rendering will happen in a Deno-based edge function that's deployed close to the site visitor. If set to `false` (the default), the site will deploy to Node-based Netlify Functions.

```js
// @errors: 2307
/// file: svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';

export default {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// will create a Netlify Edge Function using Deno-based
			// rather than using standard Node-based functions
			edge: true
		})
	}
};
```

## Edge Middleware

You can deploy one Netlify Edge Function [as middleware](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/api/#modify-a-response) by placing an `edge-middleware.js` file in your `src` folder. Unlike the [handle](/docs/kit/hooks#Server-hooks-handle) hook, middleware can run on all requests, including for static assets and prerendered pages. If using [server-side route resolution](configuration#router) this means it runs prior to all navigations, no matter client- or server-side. This allows you to for example run A/B-tests on prerendered pages by rerouting a user to either variant A or B depending on a cookie.

```js
/// file: edge-middleware.js
// @filename: ambient.d.ts
declare module '@netlify/edge-functions';

// @filename: index.js
// ---cut---
import { normalizeUrl } from '@sveltejs/kit';

/**
 * @param {Request} request
 * @param {import('@netlify/edge-functions').Context} context
 */
export default async function middleware(request, { next, cookies }) {
	const url = new URL(request.url);

	if (url.pathname !== '/') return next();

	// Retrieve feature flag from cookies
	let flag = cookies.get('flag');

	if (!flag) {
		// Fall back to random value if this is a new visitor
		flag = Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'a' : 'b';

		// Set a cookie to remember the feature flags for this visitor
		cookies.set('flag', flag);
	}

	// Get destination URL based on the feature flag
	return new URL(flag === 'a' ? '/home-a' : '/home-b', url);
}
```

[!NOTE] If you can do what you need to by using the [handle hook](hooks#Server-hooks-handle), do so. Avoid using edge middleware for requests that will end up hitting the SvelteKit server runtime (instead of e.g. static content) â€” it would be unnecessary (even if very small) overhead. Notable use cases include A/B testing using rerouting on prerendered pages, or adding headers to requests for static assets.

By default middleware runs on all requests except for SvelteKit-internal artifacts (such as the compiled JS files; normally within `_app/`). You can customize this by exporting a `export const config = { pattern: '<regex string>' }` object from the file similar to [how you can do it for native edge functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/#declare-edge-functions-inline). Due to the aforementioned performance impact, you should configure this to only run on requests that actually need edge middleware.

> [!NOTE] Locally during dev and preview this only approximates the capabilities of edge functions. Notably, you cannot read the request or response body, and many properties on the context object are `null`ed.

## Netlify alternatives to SvelteKit functionality

You may build your app using functionality provided directly by SvelteKit without relying on any Netlify functionality. Using the SvelteKit versions of these features will allow them to be used in dev mode, tested with integration tests, and to work with other adapters should you ever decide to switch away from Netlify. However, in some scenarios you may find it beneficial to use the Netlify versions of these features. One example would be if you're migrating an app that's already hosted on Netlify to SvelteKit.

### Redirect rules

During compilation, redirect rules are automatically appended to your `_redirects` file. (If it doesn't exist yet, it will be created.) That means:

- `[[redirects]]` in `netlify.toml` will never match as `_redirects` has a [higher priority](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#rule-processing-order). So always put your rules in the [`_redirects` file](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file).
- `_redirects` shouldn't have any custom "catch all" rules such as `/* /foobar/:splat`. Otherwise the automatically appended rule will never be applied as Netlify is only processing [the first matching rule](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#rule-processing-order).

### Netlify Forms

1. Create your Netlify HTML form as described [here](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#html-forms), e.g. as `/routes/contact/+page.svelte`. (Don't forget to add the hidden `form-name` input element!)
2. Netlify's build bot parses your HTML files at deploy time, which means your form must be [prerendered](page-options#prerender) as HTML. You can either add `export const prerender = true` to your `contact.svelte` to prerender just that page or set the `kit.prerender.force: true` option to prerender all pages.
3. If your Netlify form has a [custom success message](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#success-messages) like `<form netlify ... action="/success">` then ensure the corresponding `/routes/success/+page.svelte` exists and is prerendered.

### Netlify Functions

With this adapter, SvelteKit endpoints are hosted as [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/). Netlify function handlers have additional context, including [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/) information. You can access this context via the `event.platform.context` field inside your hooks and `+page.server` or `+layout.server` endpoints. These are [serverless functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) when the `edge` property is `false` in the adapter config or [edge functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/#app) when it is `true`.

```js
// @errors: 2705 7006
/// file: +page.server.js
export const load = async (event) => {
	const context = event.platform.context;
	console.log(context); // shows up in your functions log in the Netlify app
};
```

Additionally, you can add your own Netlify functions by creating a directory for them and adding the configuration to your `netlify.toml` file. For example:

```toml
[build]
	command = "npm run build"
	publish = "build"

[functions]
	directory = "functions"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Accessing the file system

You can't use `fs` in edge deployments.

You _can_ use it in serverless deployments, but it won't work as expected, since files are not copied from your project into your deployment. Instead, use the [`read`]($app-server#read) function from `$app/server` to access your files. `read` does not work inside edge deployments (this may change in future).

Alternatively, you can [prerender](page-options#prerender) the routes in question.
