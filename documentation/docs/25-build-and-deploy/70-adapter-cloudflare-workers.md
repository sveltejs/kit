title: Cloudflare Workers
---

To deploy to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), use [`adapter-cloudflare-workers`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/adapter-cloudflare-workers).

> Unless you have a specific reason to use `adapter-cloudflare-workers`, it's recommended that you use `adapter-cloudflare` instead. Both adapters have equivalent functionality, but Cloudflare Pages offers features like GitHub integration with automatic builds and deploys, preview deployments, instant rollback and so on.

## Usage

Install with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers`, then add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js`:

```js
// @errors: 2307
/// file: svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers';

export default {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
      config: 'wrangler.toml',
			platformProxy: {
				configPath: 'wrangler.toml',
				environment: undefined,
				experimentalJsonConfig: false,
				persist: false
			}
    })
	}
};
```

## Options

### config

Path to your custom `wrangler.toml` config file.

### platformProxy

Preferences for the emulated `platform.env` local bindings. See the [getPlatformProxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#syntax) Wrangler API documentation for a full list of options.

## Basic Configuration

This adapter expects to find a [wrangler.toml](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/sites/configuration) file in the project root. It should look something like this:

```toml
/// file: wrangler.toml
name = "<your-service-name>"
account_id = "<your-account-id>"

main = "./.cloudflare/worker.js"
site.bucket = "./.cloudflare/public"

build.command = "npm run build"

compatibility_date = "2021-11-12"
workers_dev = true
```

`<your-service-name>` can be anything. `<your-account-id>` can be found by logging into your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and grabbing it from the end of the URL:

```
https://dash.cloudflare.com/<your-account-id>
```

> You should add the `.cloudflare` directory (or whichever directories you specified for `main` and `site.bucket`) to your `.gitignore`.

You will need to install [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/) and log in, if you haven't already:

```
npm i -g wrangler
wrangler login
```

Then, you can build your app and deploy it:

```sh
wrangler deploy
```

## Custom config

If you would like to use a config file other than `wrangler.toml` you can specify so using the [`config` option](#options-config).

If you would like to enable [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/#enable-nodejs-from-the-cloudflare-dashboard), you can add "nodejs_compat" flag to `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
/// file: wrangler.toml
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
```

## Runtime APIs

The [`env`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#parameters) object contains your project's [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/bindings/), which consist of KV/DO namespaces, etc. It is passed to SvelteKit via the `platform` property, along with [`context`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/#contextwaituntil), [`caches`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/), and [`cf`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#the-cf-property-requestinitcfproperties), meaning that you can access it in hooks and endpoints:

```js
// @errors: 7031
export async function POST({ request, platform }) {
	const x = platform.env.YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE.idFromName('x');
}
```

> SvelteKit's built-in `$env` module should be preferred for environment variables.

To include type declarations for your bindings, reference them in your `src/app.d.ts`:

```diff
/// file: src/app.d.ts
declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Platform {
+			env?: {
+				YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
+				YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE: DurableObjectNamespace;
+			};
		}
	}
}

export {};
```

### Testing Locally

Cloudflare Workers specific values in the `platform` property are emulated during dev and preview modes. Local [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bindings) are created based on the configuration in your `wrangler.toml` file and are used to populate `platform.env` during development and preview. Use the adapter config [`platformProxy` option](#options-platformproxy) to change your preferences for the bindings.

For testing the build, you should use [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler) **version 3**. Once you have built your site, run `wrangler dev`.

## Troubleshooting

### Worker size limits

When deploying to workers, the server generated by SvelteKit is bundled into a single file. Wrangler will fail to publish your worker if it exceeds [the size limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-size) after minification. You're unlikely to hit this limit usually, but some large libraries can cause this to happen. In that case, you can try to reduce the size of your worker by only importing such libraries on the client side. See [the FAQ](./faq#how-do-i-use-x-with-sveltekit-how-do-i-use-a-client-side-only-library-that-depends-on-document-or-window) for more information.

### Accessing the file system

You can't use `fs` in Cloudflare Workers â€” you must [prerender](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#prerender) the routes in question.
