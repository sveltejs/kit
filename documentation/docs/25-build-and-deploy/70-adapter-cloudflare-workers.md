title: Cloudflare Workers
---

To deploy to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), use [`adapter-cloudflare-workers`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/adapter-cloudflare-workers).

## Comparisons

- `adapter-cloudflare-workers` – supports all SvelteKit features; builds for Cloudflare Workers
- `adapter-cloudflare` – supports all SvelteKit features; builds for Cloudflare Pages
- `adapter-static` – only produces client-side static assets; compatible with Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers

## Usage

Install with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers`, then add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js`:

```js
// @errors: 2307
/// file: svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers';

export default {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// see below for options that can be set here
		})
	}
};
```

## Options

### config

Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). If you would like to use a Wrangler configuration filename other than `wrangler.jsonc`, you can specify it using this option.

### platformProxy

Preferences for the emulated `platform.env` local bindings. See the [getPlatformProxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#parameters-1) Wrangler API documentation for a full list of options.

## Basic Configuration

This adapter expects to find a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/sites/configuration/) in the project root. It should look something like this:

```jsonc
/// file: wrangler.jsonc
{
	"name": "<your-service-name>",
	"main": ".svelte-kit/cloudflare/_worker.js",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-01-01",
	"assets": {
		"binding": "ASSETS",
		"directory": ".svelte-kit/cloudflare",
	}
}
```

## Deployment

Please follow the [framework guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/svelte/) for Cloudflare Workers to begin.

## Runtime APIs

The [`env`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#parameters) object contains your project's [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/), which consist of KV/DO namespaces, etc. It is passed to SvelteKit via the `platform` property, along with [`context`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/), [`caches`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/), and [`cf`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties), meaning that you can access it in hooks and endpoints:

```js
// @errors: 7031
export async function POST({ request, platform }) {
	const x = platform.env.YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE.idFromName('x');
}
```

> [!NOTE] SvelteKit's built-in [`$env` module]($env-static-private) should be preferred for environment variables.

To make these types available to your app, install [`@cloudflare/workers-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types) and reference them in your `src/app.d.ts`:

```ts
/// file: src/app.d.ts
+++import { KVNamespace, DurableObjectNamespace } from '@cloudflare/workers-types';+++

declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Platform {
+++			env?: {
				YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
				YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE: DurableObjectNamespace;
			};+++
		}
	}
}

export {};
```

### Testing Locally

Cloudflare Workers specific values in the `platform` property are emulated during dev and preview modes. Local [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bindings) are created based on your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) and are used to populate `platform.env` during development and preview. Use the adapter config [`platformProxy` option](#Options-platformProxy) to change your preferences for the bindings.

For testing the build, you should use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) **version 3**. Once you have built your site, run `wrangler dev`.

## Notes

The [`_headers`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/) and [`_redirects`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/) files specific to Cloudflare Pages can be used for static asset responses (like images) by putting them into the project root folder.

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js compatibility

If you would like to enable [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/), you can add the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag to your Wrangler configuration file:

```jsonc
/// file: wrangler.jsonc
{
	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]
}
```

### Worker size limits

When deploying your application, the server generated by SvelteKit is bundled into a single file. Wrangler will fail to publish your worker if it exceeds [the size limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-size) after minification. You're unlikely to hit this limit usually, but some large libraries can cause this to happen. In that case, you can try to reduce the size of your worker by only importing such libraries on the client side. See [the FAQ](./faq#How-do-I-use-a-client-side-library-accessing-document-or-window) for more information.

### Accessing the file system

You can't use `fs` in Cloudflare Workers — you must [prerender](page-options#prerender) the routes in question.

## Migrating from Workers Sites to Workers Static Assets

Cloudflare no longer recommends using [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/sites/configuration/) and instead recommends using [Workers Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/). To migrate, remove all `site` configuration settings from your Wrangler configuration file.
