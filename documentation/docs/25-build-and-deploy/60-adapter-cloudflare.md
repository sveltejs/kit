title: Cloudflare
---

To deploy to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), use [`adapter-cloudflare`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/adapter-cloudflare).

This adapter will be installed by default when you use [`adapter-auto`](adapter-auto). If you plan on staying with Cloudflare, you can switch from [`adapter-auto`](adapter-auto) to using this adapter directly so that `event.platform` is emulated during local development, type declarations are automatically applied, and the ability to set Cloudflare-specific options is provided.

## Comparisons

- `adapter-cloudflare` – supports all SvelteKit features; builds for Cloudflare Workers Static Assets and Cloudflare Pages
- `adapter-cloudflare-workers` – deprecated. Supports all SvelteKit features; builds for Cloudflare Workers Sites
- `adapter-static` – only produces client-side static assets; compatible with Cloudflare Workers Static Assets and Cloudflare Pages

## Usage

Install with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`, then add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js`:

```js
/// file: svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// See below for an explanation of these options
			config: undefined,
			platformProxy: {
				configPath: undefined,
				environment: undefined,
				persist: undefined
			},
			fallback: 'plaintext',
			routes: {
				include: ['/*'],
				exclude: ['<all>']
			}
		})
	}
};

export default config;
```

## Options

### config

Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). If you would like to use a Wrangler configuration filename other than `wrangler.jsonc`, `wrangler.json`, or `wrangler.toml` you can specify it using this option.

### platformProxy

Preferences for the emulated `platform.env` local bindings. See the [getPlatformProxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#parameters-1) Wrangler API documentation for a full list of options.

### fallback

Whether to render a plaintext 404.html page or a rendered SPA fallback page for non-matching asset requests.

For Cloudflare Workers, the default behaviour is to return a null-body 404-status response for non-matching assets requests. However, if the [`assets.not_found_handling`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/#2-not_found_handling) Wrangler configuration setting is set to `"404-page"`, this page will be served if a request fails to match an asset. If `assets.not_found_handling` is set to `"single-page-application"`, the adapter will render a SPA fallback index.html page regardless of the `fallback` option specified.

For Cloudflare Pages, this page will only be served when a request that matches an entry in `routes.exclude` fails to match an asset.

Most of the time `plaintext` is sufficient, but if you are using `routes.exclude` to manually
exclude a set of prerendered pages without exceeding the 100 route limit, you may wish to
use `spa` instead to avoid showing an unstyled 404 page to users.

See Cloudflare Pages' [Not Found behaviour](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/serving-pages/#not-found-behavior) for more info.

### routes

Only for Cloudflare Pages. Allows you to customise the [`_routes.json`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/routing/#create-a-_routesjson-file) file generated by `adapter-cloudflare`.

- `include` defines routes that will invoke a function, and defaults to `['/*']`
- `exclude` defines routes that will _not_ invoke a function — this is a faster and cheaper way to serve your app's static assets. This array can include the following special values:
	- `<build>` contains your app's build artifacts (the files generated by Vite)
	- `<files>` contains the contents of your `static` directory
	- `<prerendered>` contains a list of prerendered pages
	- `<all>` (the default) contains all of the above

You can have up to 100 `include` and `exclude` rules combined. Generally you can omit the `routes` options, but if (for example) your `<prerendered>` paths exceed that limit, you may find it helpful to manually create an `exclude` list that includes `'/articles/*'` instead of the auto-generated `['/articles/foo', '/articles/bar', '/articles/baz', ...]`.

## Cloudflare Workers

### Basic configuration

When building for Cloudflare Workers, this adapter expects to find a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/sites/configuration/) in the project root. It should look something like this:

```jsonc
/// file: wrangler.jsonc
{
	"name": "<any-name-you-want>",
	"main": ".svelte-kit/cloudflare/_worker.js",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-01-01",
	"assets": {
		"binding": "ASSETS",
		"directory": ".svelte-kit/cloudflare",
	}
}
```

### Deployment

Please follow the [framework guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/svelte/) for Cloudflare Workers to begin.

## Cloudflare Pages

### Deployment

Please follow the [Get Started Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/) for Cloudflare Pages to begin.

If you're using the [Git integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/git-integration/), your build settings should look like this:

- Framework preset – SvelteKit
- Build command – `npm run build` or `vite build`
- Build output directory – `.svelte-kit/cloudflare`

### Further reading

You may wish to refer to [Cloudflare's documentation for deploying a SvelteKit site on Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-kit-site/).

### Notes

Functions contained in the [`/functions` directory](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/routing/) at the project's root will _not_ be included in the deployment. Instead, functions should be implemented as [server endpoints](routing#server) in your SvelteKit app, which is compiled to a [single `_worker.js` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/advanced-mode/).

## Runtime APIs

The [`env`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#parameters) object contains your project's [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/), which consist of KV/DO namespaces, etc. It is passed to SvelteKit via the `platform` property, along with [`ctx`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/), [`caches`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/), and [`cf`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties), meaning that you can access it in hooks and endpoints:

```js
// @filename: ambient.d.ts
import { DurableObjectNamespace } from '@cloudflare/workers-types';

declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Platform {
			env: {
				YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE: DurableObjectNamespace;
			};
		}
	}
}
// @filename: +server.js
// ---cut---
// @errors: 2355 2322
/// file: +server.js
/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */
export async function POST({ request, platform }) {
	const x = platform?.env.YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE.idFromName('x');
}
```

> [!NOTE] SvelteKit's built-in [`$env` module]($env-static-private) should be preferred for environment variables.

To make these types available to your app, install [`@cloudflare/workers-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types) and reference them in your `src/app.d.ts`:

```ts
/// file: src/app.d.ts
+++import { KVNamespace, DurableObjectNamespace } from '@cloudflare/workers-types';+++

declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Platform {
+++			env: {
				YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
				YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE: DurableObjectNamespace;
			};+++
		}
	}
}

export {};
```

### Testing locally

Cloudflare specific values in the `platform` property are emulated during dev and preview modes. Local [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bindings) are created based on your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) and are used to populate `platform.env` during development and preview. Use the adapter config [`platformProxy` option](#Options-platformProxy) to change your preferences for the bindings.

For testing the build, you should use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) version 4. Once you have built your site, run `wrangler dev .svelte-kit/cloudflare` if you're testing for Cloudflare Workers or `wrangler pages dev .svelte-kit/cloudflare` for Cloudflare Pages.

## Headers and redirects

The [`_headers`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/) and [`_redirects`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/) files, specific to Cloudflare, can be used for static asset responses (like images) by putting them into the project root folder.

However, they will have no effect on responses dynamically rendered by SvelteKit, which should return custom headers or redirect responses from [server endpoints](routing#server) or with the [`handle`](hooks#Server-hooks-handle) hook.

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js compatibility

If you would like to enable [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/), you can add the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag to your Wrangler configuration file:

```jsonc
/// file: wrangler.jsonc
{
	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]
}
```

### Worker size limits

When deploying your application, the server generated by SvelteKit is bundled into a single file. Wrangler will fail to publish your worker if it exceeds [the size limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-size) after minification. You're unlikely to hit this limit usually, but some large libraries can cause this to happen. In that case, you can try to reduce the size of your worker by only importing such libraries on the client side. See [the FAQ](./faq#How-do-I-use-a-client-side-library-accessing-document-or-window) for more information.

### Accessing the file system

You can't use `fs` in Cloudflare Workers.

Instead, use the [`read`]($app-server#read) function from `$app/server` to access your files. It works by fetching the file from the deployed public assets location.

Alternatively, you can [prerender](page-options#prerender) the routes in question.

## Migrating from Workers Sites

Cloudflare no longer recommends using [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/sites/configuration/) and instead recommends using [Workers Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/). To migrate, replace `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers` with `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` and remove all `site` configuration settings from your Wrangler configuration file, then add the `assets.directory` and `assets.binding` configuration settings:

### svelte.config.js

```js
// @errors: 2307
/// file: svelte.config.js
---import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers';---
+++import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare';+++

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter()
	}
};

export default config;
```

### wrangler.toml

```toml
/// file: wrangler.toml
---site.bucket = ".cloudflare/public"---
+++assets.directory = ".cloudflare/public"
assets.binding = "ASSETS" # Exclude this if you don't have a `main` key configured.+++
```

### wrangler.jsonc

```jsonc
/// file: wrangler.jsonc
{
---	"site": {
		"bucket": ".cloudflare/public"
	},---
+++	"assets": {
		"directory": ".cloudflare/public",
		"binding": "ASSETS" // Exclude this if you don't have a `main` key configured.
	}+++
}
```
