title: Cloudflare Pages
---

To deploy to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), use [`adapter-cloudflare`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/adapter-cloudflare).

This adapter will be installed by default when you use [`adapter-auto`](adapter-auto). If you plan on staying with Cloudflare Pages, you can switch from [`adapter-auto`](adapter-auto) to using this adapter directly so that values specific to Cloudflare Workers are emulated during local development, type declarations are automatically applied, and the ability to set Cloudflare-specific options is provided.

## Comparisons

- `adapter-cloudflare` – supports all SvelteKit features; builds for [Cloudflare Pages](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-goes-full-stack/)
- `adapter-cloudflare-workers` – supports all SvelteKit features; builds for Cloudflare Workers
- `adapter-static` – only produces client-side static assets; compatible with Cloudflare Pages

## Usage

Install with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`, then add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js`:

```js
// @errors: 2307
/// file: svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare';

export default {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// See below for an explanation of these options
			routes: {
				include: ['/*'],
				exclude: ['<all>']
			},
			platformProxy: {
				configPath: undefined,
				environment: undefined,
				persist: undefined
			}
		})
	}
};
```

## Options

### routes

Allows you to customise the [`_routes.json`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/routing/#create-a-_routesjson-file) file generated by `adapter-cloudflare`.

- `include` defines routes that will invoke a function, and defaults to `['/*']`
- `exclude` defines routes that will _not_ invoke a function — this is a faster and cheaper way to serve your app's static assets. This array can include the following special values:
	- `<build>` contains your app's build artifacts (the files generated by Vite)
	- `<files>` contains the contents of your `static` directory
	- `<prerendered>` contains a list of prerendered pages
	- `<all>` (the default) contains all of the above

You can have up to 100 `include` and `exclude` rules combined. Generally you can omit the `routes` options, but if (for example) your `<prerendered>` paths exceed that limit, you may find it helpful to manually create an `exclude` list that includes `'/articles/*'` instead of the auto-generated `['/articles/foo', '/articles/bar', '/articles/baz', ...]`.

### platformProxy

Preferences for the emulated `platform.env` local bindings. See the [getPlatformProxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#parameters-1) Wrangler API documentation for a full list of options.

## Deployment

Please follow the [Get Started Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/) for Cloudflare Pages to begin.

When configuring your project settings, you must use the following settings:

- **Framework preset** – SvelteKit
- **Build command** – `npm run build` or `vite build`
- **Build output directory** – `.svelte-kit/cloudflare`

## Runtime APIs

The [`env`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#parameters) object contains your project's [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/), which consist of KV/DO namespaces, etc. It is passed to SvelteKit via the `platform` property, along with [`context`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/), [`caches`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/), and [`cf`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties), meaning that you can access it in hooks and endpoints:

```js
// @errors: 7031
export async function POST({ request, platform }) {
	const x = platform.env.YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE.idFromName('x');
}
```

> [!NOTE] SvelteKit's built-in [`$env` module]($env-static-private) should be preferred for environment variables.

To make these types available to your app, install [`@cloudflare/workers-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types) and reference them in your `src/app.d.ts`:

```ts
/// file: src/app.d.ts
+++import { KVNamespace, DurableObjectNamespace } from '@cloudflare/workers-types';+++

declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Platform {
+++			env?: {
				YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
				YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE: DurableObjectNamespace;
			};+++
		}
	}
}

export {};
```

### Testing Locally

Cloudflare Workers specific values in the `platform` property are emulated during dev and preview modes. Local [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/) are created based on your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/wrangler-configuration/#local-development) and are used to populate `platform.env` during development and preview. Use the adapter config [`platformProxy` option](#Options-platformProxy) to change your preferences for the bindings.

For testing the build, you should use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) **version 3**. Once you have built your site, run `wrangler pages dev .svelte-kit/cloudflare`.

## Notes

Functions contained in the [`/functions` directory](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/routing/) at the project's root will _not_ be included in the deployment. Instead, functions should be implemented as [server endpoints](routing#server) in your SvelteKit app, which is compiled to a [single `_worker.js` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/advanced-mode/).

The [`_headers`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/headers/) and [`_redirects`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/) files specific to Cloudflare Pages can be used for static asset responses (like images) by putting them into the `/static` folder.

However, they will have no effect on responses dynamically rendered by SvelteKit, which should return custom headers or redirect responses from [server endpoints](routing#server) or with the [`handle`](hooks#Server-hooks-handle) hook.

## Troubleshooting

### Further reading

You may wish to refer to [Cloudflare's documentation for deploying a SvelteKit site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-kit-site/).

### Node.js compatibility

If you would like to enable [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/), you can add the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag to your Wrangler configuration file:

```jsonc
/// file: wrangler.jsonc
{
	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]
}
```

### Worker size limits

When deploying your application, the server generated by SvelteKit is bundled into a single file. Wrangler will fail to publish your worker if it exceeds [the size limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-size) after minification. You're unlikely to hit this limit usually, but some large libraries can cause this to happen. In that case, you can try to reduce the size of your worker by only importing such libraries on the client side. See [the FAQ](./faq#How-do-I-use-a-client-side-library-accessing-document-or-window) for more information.

### Accessing the file system

You can't use `fs` in Cloudflare Workers — you must [prerender](page-options#prerender) the routes in question.
