title: SvelteKit app structure
---

If you take a look inside a new SvelteKit project, you'll see some files that SvelteKit expects to find:

```bash
├ package.json
├ src
│ ├ routes
│ │ └ index.svelte
│ ├ components
│ │ └ Counter.svelte
│ ├ service-worker.js
│ └ app.html
├ static
│ ├ # your files here
├ snowpack.config.cjs
└ svelte.config.cjs
```

### package.json

Your package.json contains your app's dependencies and defines a number of scripts:

- `npm run dev` — start the app in development mode, and watch source files for changes
- `npm run build` — build the app in production mode
- `npm start` — start the app in production mode after you've built it

### src

This contains the _home page_ for your app — `src/index.svelte` and (optionally) `src/service-worker.js` — along with a `src/app.html` file.

#### src/routes/index.svelte

This is the home page for your application and is just like any other Svelte component.

#### src/service-worker.js

_Currently not implemented._

Service workers act as proxy servers that give you fine-grained control over how to respond to network requests. For example, when the browser requests `/goats.jpg`, the service worker can respond with a file it previously cached, or it can pass the request on to the server, or it could even respond with something completely different, such as a picture of llamas.

Among other things, this makes it possible to build applications that work offline.

Because every app needs a slightly different service worker (sometimes it's appropriate to always serve from the cache, sometimes that should only be a last resort in case of no connectivity), Sapper doesn't attempt to control the service worker. Instead, you write the logic in `service-worker.js`. You can import any of the following from `@sapper/service-worker`:

- `files` — an array of files found in the `static` directory
- `shell` — the client-side JavaScript generated by the bundler (Rollup or webpack)
- `routes` — an array of `{ pattern: RegExp }` objects you can use to determine whether a Sapper-controlled page is being requested
- `timestamp` — the time the service worker was generated (useful for generating unique cache names)

#### src/app.html

This file is a template for responses from the server. Sapper will inject content that replaces the following tags:

- `%svelte.base%` — a `<base>` element (see [base URLs](docs#Base_URLs))
- `%svelte.styles%` — critical CSS for the page being requested
- `%svelte.head%` — HTML representing page-specific `<head>` contents, like `<title>`
- `%svelte.html%` — HTML representing the body of the page being rendered
- `%svelte.scripts%` — script tags for the client-side app
- `%svelte.cspnonce%` — CSP nonce taken from `res.locals.nonce` (see [Content Security Policy (CSP)](docs#Content_Security_Policy_CSP))

### src/routes

This is the meat of your app — the pages and server routes. See the section on [routing](docs#Routing) for the juicy details.

### static

This is a place to put any files that your app uses — fonts, images and so on. For example `static/favicon.png` will be served as `/favicon.png`.

Sapper doesn't serve these files — you'd typically use [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv) or [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) for that — but it will read the contents of the `static` folder so that you can easily generate a cache manifest for offline support (see [service-worker.js](docs#src_service-worker_js)).

> Note that the default behaviour of the service worker is to cache all assets from the static directory, so if you have more than 50mb of files here, you will start to exceed the cache limit for service-workers in some browsers, which can cause the service worker to stop loading. In this instance, it is advisable to customise what files are cached by editing the service-worker yourself.

### snowpack.config.cjs

This is the [Snowpack configuration file](https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/configuration) for your project.

### svelte.config.cjs

This file contains SvelteKit options as well as options for `svelte-preprocess`.
