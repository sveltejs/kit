**To Reproduce**

To help us help you, if you've found a bug please consider the following:

* If possible, we recommend creating a small repo that illustrates the problem.
* Reproductions should be small, self-contained, correct examples – http://sscce.org.

Occasionally, this won't be possible, and that's fine – we still appreciate you raising the issue. But please understand that Svelte is run by unpaid volunteers in their free time, and issues that follow these instructions will get fixed faster.
