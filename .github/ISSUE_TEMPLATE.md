### Feature requests and proposals

We're excited to hear how we can make SvelteKit better. Please add as much detail
as you can on your use case. To propose an implementation of a large feature or
change, please create an [RFC](https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs).

### Bugs

as you can, including the following.
